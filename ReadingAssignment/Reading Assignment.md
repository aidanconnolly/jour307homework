# Truth, truth and data journalism
###### Aidan Connolly


I don't think it’s realistic for people to expect data journalists to have the capital-T Truth. I think that expectation comes from the presence of numbers. When most people come into contact with numbers, they are assumed to be exact. If you go to the supermarket, the cashiers don’t estimate your cart’s total. They go through and add each item individually. 

For data journalists, trying to collect data is similar to checking out at the supermarket, except someone else is scanning the items, there are items in more than one cart and they are changing price even after they have been scanned. 

It is often unlikely to find a data journalist collecting his or her own data. Usually, that data is requested from another source. This can cause issues. If the data is something the source is not willing to release, they may send incomplete data, causing skewed results. 

Other times, the data is simply collected incorrectly. The source believes they are correctly collecting data and they pass it along not knowing of their error. This causes skewed results. 

A third issue is the magnitude of data and its constant evolution. As Matt Waite said in his [2014 Source article](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/true-facts-maybe/), the decennial census is destined to fail. It's unrealistic to assume the government can count each and every person living in the country. Even if the government was able to count every person in the country, by the time they finished, the number would already be wrong. 

Going back to the supermarket analogy, the census is similar to a parent trying to checkout while their kid is throwing things from the candy rack into the bags of checked items.

Because of this, the government uses sampling to estimate population. The general population then regards that information as accurate.

Here's how this relates to data journalism and epistemology. 

I believe data journalists are very similar to other journalists. Some people think data journalists are more trustworthy due to their use of numbers, but they don't realize those numbers are just a source. Just like a human source, the information given can be exaggerated, incomplete or just incorrect. Data must be verified and investigated. 

Some people blame data journalists for twisting data to fit their story. While this may be true, data journalists aren't the only ones to blame.

The very culture of journalism encourages the twisting of data. News outlets do not report on every piece of information that is presented to them. They act on the information that is uncommon, that will grab the audience's attention. 

I don't see this being any different than a data journalist using data that is uncommon. I'm not saying either approach is correct, but I don't think one group should be blamed over the other.

Even though data journalists use data as a source, the human voice is still necessary. Jonathan Stray brings this up in his book [The Curious Journalist's Guide to Data](https://www.gitbook.com/book/towcenter/curious-journalist-s-guide-to-data/details).

Even if people were given data that said a certain procedure had a higher success rate, people would not choose it if participants had testified that it wasn't as favorable.

The main responsibility added to data journalists is the need to interpret data and turn it into something readers with little knowledge about the topic can understand. 

Though not encouraged, a journalist could take quotes from a source and print them without explaining their relevance. This is because people have experience interpreting what is being said. 

If a data journalist took a data set and printed it alongside his or her article, there would likely be problems. The data must be turned into a visual element that any reader can understand. As Alberto Cairo said in his [2014 NeimanLab article](http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/07/alberto-cairo-data-journalism-needs-to-up-its-own-standards/), this means data journalism is not as appropriate for breaking news. Instead, data journalism lends itself to long-form investigative journalism.

I agree with [Nate Silver](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/) when he says data journalism is not meant to replace conventional journalism. Data journalism is simply another approach, using different methods to tell different stories. While it may require more time and more effort, I believe the resulting products are worth the work.
